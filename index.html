      <h2>What is 'Baby Reindeer'?</h2>
      <p>
        This story takes place in London, Egland, more specifically at a pub,
        where a middle aged, plus size, woman walks in. She sits down at the
        bar, trying her hardest to hold back her tears, and has no intention of
        order anything. Its roughly noon, but its London so everyone's drinking
        all the time. The main character, Donny, a bartender at the pub and
        aspiring comedic, asks her if she would like to order anything, she
        quitely shakes her head. "Not even a cup of tea?" asks Donny. "I can't
        afford it", Martha replies back. Donny felt some pity towards her so he
        gave her a cup on the house. Martha acknowldges the kind gester and
        immediately clinges on to Donny. She tells him she's a lawyer and she
        has worked with many famous clients, and all Donny could think of was
        "Then why can't she afford a cup of tea?" The first episode wastes no
        time in hooking us in. We start to realize this is a comedy about a
        mentally sick stalker who has taken a liking to Donny. But the show
        takes a sharp turn in the middle and becomes a story about trauma and
        learning how to cope with it.
